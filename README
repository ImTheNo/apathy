--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sad_droid is an implementation of an idea to have somewhat more strict Least
Privileges Principle in SELinux. It allows system administrator to set separate
security contexts on various parts of application's code. With this approach,
when application execute its code, the set of privileges depends on which piece
of code is executed at the moment. Thus every single function or object can have
separate rights in the system. This allows to decrease potential harm, whenever
some part of application was compromised. 
 
sad_droid itself is a Linux Kernel subsystem, which goal is to change SELinux
security context for a thread, whenever it transits to another piece of code,
for which security policy dictates separate security context. This transition
must be told beforehand to the sad_droid throughout special device,
/dev/sad_droid.
